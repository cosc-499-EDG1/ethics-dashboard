Client Meeting Notes
(Week of October 4, 2021)

We discussed the progress that we made this week, just stating that each of us had our own explorations that we had to do in different areas of the project.

It was agreed that we won't use the time meeting with Dr. Lowe-Walker to discuss the changes this week as we will reserve the time for questions about the project impeding progress.

We will leave the changes and improvements to teh milestones that we will be providing.

Web hosting:
	-The biggest issue that we had this week was that we weren't sure how the database for this project will be hosted
	-The web hosting that we have been provided with will be from okanaganbcwebhosting.ca
	-The domain name is https://www.lowe-walker.org/
	-We tried to find out whether we would be able to use the framework we were planning on using by asking Dr. Lowe-Walker about what they gave her as options but weren't able to get everything straight.
	-It is currently set up for c-panel but we may be able to change this or work with this
