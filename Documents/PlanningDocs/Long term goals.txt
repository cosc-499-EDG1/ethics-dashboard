Long Term Goals

As of 1st October

To have a functioning learning aid to assist with ethics courses taught at Okanagan college.
It will be defined as functioning as long as it succeeds in the following goals:
	-helps the student user group focus on writing about ethics and not relating this to economics, legal, political or practical arguements
	-help the student reach conclusions based on analysis rather than gut reaction
	-help the student user group to stay consistent with the facts of the case between ethical approaches
	-Ensure the student is contucting a detailed analysis by requiring detailed input
	-Help the Instructor user group by assisting in plagiarism prevention by generating and comparing reports from different students
	-Needs to be able to support at least 120 users

Student can create at least 4 different dashboards

Dashboards consist of several different parts:
	-Main page where all subsequent pages can be reached
	-Ethical Issue page where ethical issue can be described and the options for action can be described
		-Start with 3 options with capability to add more
	-Stakeholder page where a little blurb on ideas over who could be stakeholders
		-Start with 3 stakeholders with capability to add more
		-Stakeholders consist of two entries
			-describe the identifying feature of the stakeholder
			-describe the interests of said stakeholder
	-Utilitarianism page 1 describes the short term and long term consequences for each of the options
			-display all the options that were inputted in the ethical issue page
		-page 2 is where the student justifies the inclusion of the stakeholders
		-Following page 2 there will be 2 pages per option:
			-One page will contain sliders for determining the pleasure/pain of the short term consequences for each of the stakeholders
			-second page will contain the sliders for determing the pleasure/pain of the long term consequences for each of the stakeholders
		-The last page for Utilitarianism will aggregate the pain/pleasure scores of all the stakeholders for each option
			-This will consist of two aggregates per option where one is for short term and one is for long term
			-There will also be an area to state and explain the utilitarian decision
	-Deontology page 1 contains a small blurb about deontolgy
		-displays the options from the ethical issue page
		-for each option give a list of motivations with the option for typing a response
		-When an option is completed it will brin gthe student to one of two pages:
			-one page will result in the reasoning be hypthetical and will end further analysis on this option for deontology
			-a second page will assk the user to descibe the moral issues describing the option adn to define the moral laws that govern the actions in this option
				-This will lead to a page where each moral law will be analyzed 
	Virtue Ethics page 1 contains a game where the user has to move the cursor in order to balance the influences
		-once game is complete congratulate user
		-present user with new page where each option has a slider depicting virtue and the appropriate vices.
			-automatically rank options based on these sliders and the closeness to virtue
		-page 3 contains the stakeholdrs interests and the appropriate virtues and vices with a slider for each interest
			-automatically rank these interests, identified by stakeholder and interest
		-page 4 will show the ranks of the options and the stakeholders interest

	Care Ethics page 1 start empty and will show the progress of the analysis of each of the options pertaining to care ethics
		-a page will be given to each option:
			-these option pages will include subsections of each stakeholder
