## Backend Research

For the backend of our project, we are limited by the existing hosting provider. 
Currently a CPanel integration is being used within shared hosting.
This makes it harder to have tools such as Docker actually run alongside it.
After further research, it should be possible to run a NodeJS application using the shared hosting using Cron Jobs and running the node application manually.
However, if that is not possible then a PHP system will have to be designed and created.
