These are already created dashboards from others to give an idea of how we can start formulating our own

Option 1
    Hapara: https://hapara.com/student-dashboard/
    Hapara is a tool used by the students and teachers to structurally 
    organize their classes, it has a nice tab layout, 
    but isn't exactly the funtionality that we are looking for, 
    it can be a good reference for aesthetics though.

Option 2
    The Concord Consortium: https://concord.org/blog/track-student-work-with-class-dashboard/
    Has a good way to measure and show progress throughout tasks
    and seems to be a smooth user interface for both the students
    and teachers

Option 3 
    Classcraft: https://help.classcraft.com/hc/en-us/articles/360007574373-Viewing-and-managing-classes-on-the-School-Dashboard
    This dashboard is mainly for viewing different classes 
    and managing grades but has a good system for breaking down
    seperate classes and could be a reference for a way to strucure the different ethical topics.
