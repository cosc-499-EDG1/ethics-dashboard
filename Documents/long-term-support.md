1. Who should the client hire to maintain and update the service?
   Whoever maintains the site will need to be trusted with student and TA data regarding marking, projects, etc.
   It shouldn't take more than a few hours every week to do basic maintenance on the backend, however they will need to be available in case of any interruptions
   in the backend services.
   
2. How much should they be paid?
   The payment should be an hourly wage as they may have to work longer or shorter hours depending on how the system is handling.
   For wage, $25/hr on the low end and $31/hr high end would be fair payment. We estimate 5 hours per week while also being on call.

3. What specific skills do they require?
   Basic MySQL and Javascript knowledge is a must, however deep knowledge of technology like React and Sequelize are not directly needed.
   For styling changes, and creating a mobile app extentsion, a more skilled person would be needed to implement React Native properly.
