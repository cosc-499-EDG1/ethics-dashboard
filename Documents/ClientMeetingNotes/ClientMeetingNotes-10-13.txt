Client Meeting Notes
(Week of October 11, 2021)

We had four questions this week:

-Should the TA's and the instructors both have acces to the exact same report?
	-yes
-Will the student have to fill the entire dashboard everytime in its entirety?
	-No
-Should the student havce the option to only use one or two ethical theories?
	-Yes, as there may be assignments that focus on one theory or contrasting two theories.
-Can the students save halfway through and return to finish there work later?
	-yes (possible auto-save feature)

Our client had a few tasks for us to complete that will be beneficial to her and the projects future:
-We should find a secure way to allow only the students in the course to be able to sign up to the dashboard, possibly through some sort of email, or class link.
-We have to come up with a description for and an expected workload for a job that would be maintaining the app going forward.
-We need to try to come up with a way to incorporate the 2nd term class of this winter session taught by Dr Lowe-Walker. We can use them as testers and have them run through an assignment on the dashboard.
