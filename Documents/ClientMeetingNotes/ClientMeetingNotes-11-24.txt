Client Meeting Notes 24/11/2021

We talked about the peer testing that we are undertaking this week and how it could inform our decisions going forward.
Dr. Lowe-walker told us that she will be meeting with other ethics professors over the requirement report that we 
gave her. We expect to have some feedback from that upcoming event. This may add some more aspects to focus on within
the analyses.

--For Utilitarianism page 3-6, what's the difference between using the checkboxes on the pleasure and using the slider for pleasure?

The sliders are in place to measure the extent to which each consequence is a pleasure or a pain. The checkboxes are in
place in order to differentiate between a higher and lower power pleasure.

--For the final page on Utilitarianism, in the section for the ethical decision/course of action is the user inputting the text, or would you like this to be system generated?

The ethical decision/course of action section of the final utilitarianism analysis will be an area for the student to input text.
This will not be system generated.
